Unfortunately, the Android build system requires extensive dependency downloads and compilation that's timing out in this environment. 

For Google Play Store upload, you have two immediate options:

1. **Use the Progressive Web App approach:**
   - Your BeeTagged app is fully functional as a web application
   - Install it on Android devices via "Add to Home Screen"
   - All contact enhancement features work immediately
   - No Google Play Store approval needed

2. **Alternative APK creation:**
   - Build the APK locally using Android Studio
   - Use the project files from the android/ directory
   - This avoids the dependency download timeouts

The contact management, Facebook integration, and LinkedIn import features are all working in the web version. Would you like me to help set up the web app installation process, or would you prefer to use the Android project files with a local build environment?
