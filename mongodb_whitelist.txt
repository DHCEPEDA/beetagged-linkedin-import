# MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist Instructions

To ensure your Replit application can connect to MongoDB Atlas, you need to add Replit's 
IP address to your MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist:

1. Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account at https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Navigate to your "ClusterBeeTagged" cluster
3. Click on "Network Access" in the left sidebar menu
4. Click the green "Add IP Address" button
5. Add the following IP address: 34.9.111.200
6. Add a comment like "Replit IP" for future reference
7. Click "Confirm"

IMPORTANT: You may also want to consider adding 0.0.0.0/0 to allow access from anywhere temporarily for testing. 
You can always remove this open access later and only keep the specific Replit IP.

To add open access:
1. Click "Add IP Address" again
2. Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (this adds 0.0.0.0/0)
3. Add comment like "Temporary open access for testing"
4. Click "Confirm"

After adding this IP address, your Replit application will be able to connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

Note: Replit IP addresses may change occasionally. If you encounter connection errors in the future,
you may need to check for updated IP ranges.
