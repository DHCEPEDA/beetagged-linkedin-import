# HEROKU DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Problem
Your Squarespace widget shows "Operating in offline mode" because your Heroku app is still running the old backend code, not the new ultra-reliable version.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Update Your Heroku index.js
1. Go to your Heroku dashboard
2. Open your `beetagged-api-ee20e3e0c789` app
3. Replace the entire contents of `index.js` with the code from `backend-ultra-reliable.js`

### Step 2: Deploy
After updating the file, Heroku will automatically redeploy.

### Step 3: Update Squarespace
Use the corrected `SQUARESPACE-ULTRA-RELIABLE.html` (which now has the correct backend URL)

## What This Will Fix
- "Operating in offline mode" error will disappear
- Green status indicator will show "Service Online"
- All search, Facebook, and LinkedIn features will work reliably
- App will handle any temporary issues gracefully

## Expected Result
Once deployed, your Heroku API will respond with JSON instead of HTML, and the Squarespace widget will connect successfully.
