## What Was Fixed
- Enhanced search API with better keyword matching

- Added helpful search examples

## Deploy Updated Code to Heroku

### Option 1: Git Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix search functionality and enhance natural language queries"

# Push to Heroku
git push heroku main
```

### Option 2: Heroku CLI Deployment
```bash
# If you haven't connected Git yet
heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

### Option 3: GitHub Integration
1. Push code to your GitHub repository
2. In Heroku dashboard, go to Deploy tab
3. Connect to GitHub repository
4. Click "Deploy Branch" for main branch

## After Deployment
1. Your Heroku app will restart automatically
2. Search functionality will work on production
3. Test the search with queries like:
   - "Google"
   - "Engineer" 
   - "Seattle"
   - Natural language queries

## Verify Deployment
Visit your Heroku app URL and test the search bar - it should now be fully responsive!

Replace "your-heroku-app-name" with your actual Heroku app name.
