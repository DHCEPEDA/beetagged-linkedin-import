LinkedIn is providing the Member Data Portability (3rd Party) API product for third party developers in response to certain requirements of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA is a new EU competition law that regulates large online platforms to ensure fair competition, protect consumer rights, and foster innovation in the digital economy. Consistent with DMA obligations regarding end user data access and portability, the Member Data Portability (3rd Party) product provides APIs that allow third party developer 3rd Party applications to fetch a LinkedIn member's LinkedIn data with their consent.
