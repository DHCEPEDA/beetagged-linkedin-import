Here are the most common steps to force Replit to pick up your latest changes and get your LinkedIn import working on your public URL:

Verify your redirect URIs and secrets

In your LinkedIn Developer console make sure the exact Replit domain (including https:// and any trailing slash) is listed under “Authorized Redirect URLs.”

In Replit’s Secrets panel, double-check that LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID, LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET and any other env vars match your LinkedIn app settings.

Clear Replit’s build cache & redeploy
Replit sometimes serves a cached build. Open the Shell pane and run:

bash
Copy
rm -rf node_modules \
  && npm install \
  && killall node    # stops any stray processes
Then in the left sidebar click Deployments → Redeploy (or stop & hit Run again).

Ensure your .replit run command matches production
Open your .replit file and confirm you’re not using a “dev” script that only runs locally. For example:

ini
Copy
language = "nodejs"
run = "npm start"
If you’ve been running npm run dev for local hot-reload, switch it to whatever command actually builds & serves your code in production.

Check the Replit deployment URL
Sometimes Replit shows both a “Preview” URL and a “Deployed” URL. Make sure you’re testing the one under Deployments > Domains (it’s usually https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co).

Restart and inspect logs

Click Stop, then Run.

Open the Logs panel and watch for any errors on startup or during an OAuth callback.

If you see a 404 on your /api/auth/linkedin/callback route, that means your code didn’t actually compile to your deployed instance.

(Optional) Use replit deploy CLI
If you push your code via GitHub, or want to script it, install Replit’s CLI and run:

bash
Copy
npx replit deploy --public
This will push your latest commit directly to your Replit deployment.

Why this happens
Replit’s “always-on” instances will occasionally serve an older build until you explicitly clear cache or redeploy, and environment variables in Secrets only load on a fresh start. By wiping node_modules, reinstalling, and restarting your Repl under the production run command, you force it to pull in both your code changes and updated secrets. Once the callback URL and client/secret are correct, LinkedIn OAuth will work exactly as it does on your local machine.
