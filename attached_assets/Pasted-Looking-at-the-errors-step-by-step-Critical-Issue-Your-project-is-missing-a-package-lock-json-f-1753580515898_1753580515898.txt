package.json
Critical Steps to Fix Your Project:

Create package-lock.json: Run npm install in your project root directory
You cannot modify the main package.json - you'll need to create a separate frontend repository with the correct dependencies
Since I cannot modify your package.json, you need to create a new frontend repository with these files:

Copy all src/ files to the new repo
Use the corrected package.json I showed above
Run npm install to generate package-lock.json
Deploy the new repo to Heroku
The Badge and Button types are now fixed, but the missing dependencies require a fresh installation with the proper package.json.
