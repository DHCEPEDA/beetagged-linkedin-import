LinkedIn is providing the Pages Data Portability API product for third-party developers and business users in response to certain requirements of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The API Product packages many APIs to access the data from the LinkedIn platform.

What is the DMA?
The DMA is a new EU competition law that regulates large online platforms to ensure fair competition, protect consumer rights, and foster innovation in the digital economy. Consistent with DMA obligations regarding business user data access, LinkedIn is providing a set of APIs for Company Page admins to access: 1) data they have provided on the LinkedIn platform or generated in the context of using LinkedIn and 2) data provided or generated by LinkedIn members through their engagement with Pages (subject to their consent).

What is a Company Page?
A Company Page is an entity that represents an organization on LinkedIn. The Company Page is where a company can post organic content and interact with members on LinkedIn.

See Creating a LinkedIn Page guide for instructions on creating a company page.

Member Personal Data
Many APIs return member information, such as a commenter on a post, the creator of a post, or the content of a member post. As explained in this section, LinkedIn's members have control over returning certain data through the Pages Data Portability API product.

Member Setting to Opt In to Sharing Data
The Page owners exporting your data setting allows members to opt in to sharing some of their profile data and individual interactions with Pages via the Pages Data Portability API. When a member opts in to sharing their data by turning this privacy setting "on", the appropriate fields will be part of the API response.

When the privacy setting is turned "off", that means a member has not opted in to sharing their data, and no member urn or ID will be part of the API response. This setting is "off" by default and is available to members globally.

Member Data Obfuscation
Some of the APIs that are included in the Pages Data Portability API product may obfuscate member data subject to members’ Page owners exporting your data setting. The documentation for each API explains which fields may be removed for privacy purposes.

How to use Pagination Cursor and Max Pagination Count
Some of the APIs that are included in the Pages Data Portability API product use a pagination cursor to navigate through the data. This pagination cursor is used for the APIs that may potentially return a large amount of content, such as an organization's followers.

PaginationCursor is an alphanumeric token of type String. It is similar to pagination start, representing the starting index to fetch results. When a null cursor is passed in, this is the equivalent of having start = 0, and results from the beginning of the list will be fetched instead. Clients do not ever generate the paginationCursor token. Instead, a new paginationCursor pointing to the starting index of the next set of results is always returned in the response metadata of the response (via the PaginationCursorMetadata.nextPaginationCursor field). If the response metadata contains a null nextPaginationCursor, the end of the result list has been reached.

MaxPaginationCount of type Integer. It is similar to pagination count, indicating the number of results the client would like to fetch. Unlike pagination count, maxPaginationCount cannot determine when the end of the result list has been reached by comparing the maxPaginationCount sent for a given request to the number of actual results returned. Instead, clients need to look for a null paginationCursor returned in the response metadata to know when the end of the result list is reached. Clients can set maxPaginationCount to any number from 0 to the maximum number authorized by LinkedIn's APIs.

Scenario where a pagination cursor can be used
If you want to find followers for an organization, you can use the endpoint https://api.linkedin.com/rest/dmaOrganizationalPageFollows?q=followee. A sample request for this will look like hhttps://api.linkedin.com/rest/dmaOrganizationalPageFollows?q=followee&followee=urn%3Ali%3AorganizationalPage%3A{ORGANIZATION_ID}&edgeType=MEMBER_FOLLOWS_ORGANIZATIONAL_PAGE&maxPaginationCount=8&paginationCursor={PAGINATION_CURSOR} (See Organizational Page Follows API for more details.).

The response from this API may contain nextPaginationCursor in metadata. You can use the nextPaginationCursor value, like https://api.linkedin.com/rest/dmaOrganizationalPageFollows?q=followee&followee=urn%3Ali%3AorganizationalPage%3A {ORGANIZATION_ID}&edgeType=MEMBER_FOLLOWS_ORGANIZATIONAL_PAGE&maxPaginationCount=8&paginationCursor={nextPaginationCursor}. This URL will return the next set of responses for the API.
