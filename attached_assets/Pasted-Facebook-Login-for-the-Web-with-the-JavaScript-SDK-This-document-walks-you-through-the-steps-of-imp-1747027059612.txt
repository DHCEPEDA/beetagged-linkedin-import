Facebook Login for the Web with the JavaScript SDK
This document walks you through the steps of implementing Facebook Login with the Facebook SDK for JavaScript on your webpage.

Before You Start
You will need the following:

A Facebook Developer Account 
A Facebook App ID  for a website
Basic Automatic Login Example
The following code sample shows you how to add the Facebook SDK for Javascript to your webpage, initialize the SDK, and, if you are logged in to Facebook, will display your name and email. If you are not logged into Facebook, the login dialog popup window will automatically be displayed.

The public_profile permission , which allows you to get publicly available information such as name and profile picture, and the email permission  do not require app review and are automatically granted to all apps using Facebook Login.

                              if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}
                              js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
                              js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js";
                              fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);

        window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
            <!-- Initialize the SDK with your app and the Graph API version for your app -->
            FB.init({
                      appId            : '{your-facebook-app-id}',
                      xfbml            : true,
                      version          : '{the-graph-api-version-for-your-app}'
                    });
            <!-- If you are logged in, automatically get your name and email adress, your public profile information -->
            FB.login(function(response) {
                      if (response.authResponse) {
                           console.log('Welcome!  Fetching your information.... ');
                           FB.api('/me', {fields: 'name, email'}, function(response) {
                               document.getElementById("profile").innerHTML = "Good to see you, " + response.name + ". i see your email address is " + response.email
                           });
                      } else { 
                           <!-- If you are not logged in, the login dialog will open for you to login asking for permission to get your public profile and email -->
                           console.log('User cancelled login or did not fully authorize.'); }
            });
        };

      </script>

  </body>
</html>
1. Enable JavaScript SDK for Facebook Login
In the App Dashboard, choose your app and scroll to Add a Product Click Set Up in the Facebook Login card. Select Settings in the left side navigation panel and under Client OAuth Settings, enter your redirect URL in the Valid OAuth Redirect URIs field for successful authorization.

Indicate that you are using the JavaScript SDK for login by setting the Login with JavaScript SDK toggle to “yes”, and enter the domain of your page that hosts the SDK in Allowed Domains for JavaScript SDK list. This ensures that access tokens are only returned to callbacks in authorized domains. Only https pages are supported for authentication actions with the Facebook JavaScript SDK.

2. Check Login Status of a Person
The first step when your webpage loads is determining if a person is already logged into your webpage with Facebook Login. A call to FB.getLoginStatus starts a call to Facebook to get the login status. Facebook then calls your callback function with the results.

Sample Call
FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) {
    statusChangeCallback(response);
});
Sample JSON Response
{
    status: 'connected',
    authResponse: {
        accessToken: '{access-token}',
        expiresIn:'{unix-timestamp}',
        reauthorize_required_in:'{seconds-until-token-expires}',
        signedRequest:'{signed-parameter}',
        userID:'{user-id}'
    }
}
status specifies the login status of the person using the webpage. The status can be one of the following:

Status Type	Description
connected

The person is logged into Facebook, and has logged into your webpage.

not_authorized

The person is logged into Facebook, but has not logged into your webpage.

unknown

The person is not logged into Facebook, so you don't know if they have logged into your webpage. Or FB.logout() was called before, and therefore, it cannot connect to Facebook.

If the status is connected, the following authResponse parameters are included in the response:

authResponse Parameters	Value
accessToken

An access token for the person using the webpage.

expiresIn

A UNIX time stamp when the token expires. Once the token expires, the person will need to login again.

reauthorize_required_in

The amount of time before the login expires, in seconds, and the person will need to login again.

signedRequest

A signed parameter that contains information about the person using your webpage.

userID

The ID of the person using your webpage.

The JavaScript SDK automatically detects login status, so you don't need to do anything to enable this behavior.

3. Log a Person In
If a person opens your webpage but is not logged in or not logged in to Facebook, you can use the Login dialog to prompt them to log in to both. If they are not logged into Facebook, they will first be prompted to log in, then prompted to log in to your webpage.

There are two ways to log someone in:

The Facebook Login Button
The Login Dialog from the JavaScript SDK
A. Log In with the Login Button
To use the Facebook Login Button, use our Plugin Configurator to customize the Login Button and get the code.

B. Log In with the Javascript SDK Login Dialog
To use your own login button, invoke the Login Dialog with a call to FB.login().

FB.login(function(response){
  // handle the response 
});
Ask for Additional Permissions
When a person clicks your HTML button a pop-up window with the Login dialog is shown. This dialog allows you to ask for permission to access a person's data. The scope parameter can be passed along with the FB.login() function call. This optional parameter is a list of permissions, separated by commas, that a person must confirm to give your webpage access to their data. Facebook Login requires dvanced public_profile permission, to be used by external users.

Sample Call
This example asks the person logging in if your webpage can have permission to access their public profile and email.

FB.login(function(response) {
  // handle the response
}, {scope: 'public_profile,email'});
Handle the Login Dialog Response
The response, either to connect or to cancel, returns an authResponse object to the callback specified when you called FB.login(). This response can be detected and handled within the FB.login().
