                "rel": "next",

            "snapshotData": [
                {

            ],
            "snapshotDomain": "PROFILE"
        }
    ]
}

 Note

In the response elements field will always contain exactly 1 element with snapshotDomain specifying domain. The snapshotData field would be a list with data generated for the specific domain.

Response Pagination
The response can contain a lot of information depending on the domain specified in the request. In order to reduce latency the response may be paginated where the snapshotData is divided across multiple pages. If the response is paginated and the data is divided into multiple pages, the paging field will contain links to access the next and prev pages. The start query parameter determines which page you want to fetch.

 Note

The "total" count field may not fully reflect the total number of pages to be retrieved as some data is retrieved through offline systems. Please continue looping through the pages until you receive an error message indicating "No data found for this memberId".
