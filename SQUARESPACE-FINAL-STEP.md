# Final Step: Add BeeTagged to Your Squarespace Page

## What You've Done So Far ✅
- ✅ Added JavaScript to Code Injection (Header & Footer)
- ✅ Added CSS to Custom CSS section

## Final Step: Add the App Container

### Go to Your Squarespace Page:
1. **Edit the page** where you want BeeTagged to appear
2. **Add a Code Block** (found in the content blocks)
3. **Paste this HTML**:

```html
<div id="my-react-app-root"></div>
```

### That's It!

Once you add that div element, your BeeTagged professional contact search will load automatically on that page.

## What You'll See:
- Professional search interface
- "Who do you know at Google?" search functionality  
- Contact upload capability
- Backend connection status
- Contact search results

## Test the Integration:
- Visit your Squarespace page
- You should see the BeeTagged interface load
- Test a search query like "Google" or "Engineer"
- Upload a LinkedIn CSV to populate contacts

Your professional contact search platform is now live on Squarespace with your Heroku backend!
